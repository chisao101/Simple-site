                <p>I started this company to escape the rat-race of serving the interests of corporate America and get
                    back
                    to serving my community. I decided a long time ago that I would rather work for a company that puts
                    the
                    client first. I feel that the best way to serve my community is to do the opposite of what corporate
                    America does. When you call me, there is no robotic voice telling you to press a button to reach me.
                    A
                    real human being will answer the phone. I like to deal with clients in a one-on-one, face-to-face
                    manner. This is what separates me from the rest.</p>
                <p>I want my clients to feel like they matter. My company is focused on serving the client, and that
                    means I
                    will be available to answer questions and address the concerns of my clients without any barriers
                    between us.</p>
